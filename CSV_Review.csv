"When it arrives around before dusk, the line is not long. But here is a prayer room, don't worry."
"Fast-moving lane and self service. Spacious dining area, can pay extra for AC space. Food is above average. Took chicken, cockles, squid with a syrup drink is RM 22. You can get free filter water at the hand wash."
Their nasi lemak tasted normal.
"Had this famous nasi Lemak for breakfast today. Came at 8:30am (public holiday today). It was open and already half full. There was a que but it was moving fast, thanks to ordering process."
"Serving only nasi lemak, this huge restaurant offers various sides, fruit juices/smoothies, and desserts. There are 2 lines for either dining in or take out. Portions were not too big. The food was delicious. Lots of workers and plenty of "
Nice and clean place. Price reasonable. Can try.
"The food is very delicious and great!. Cheap price, recommend everyone to try it!!!"
Good to try. Taste better. But sambal not hot.
"Don't buy their food online. Terrible service, after 1 hour still in process with an excuse that they have too many customers onsite. Asked for refund also not prompt"
The sambal so delicious 
"The overall food is okay. The sambal is good. The portion of nasi lemak is very small compared to the price. Even for someone like me who eats less rice it is insufficient. Hehe, but overall, it's okay; there is just a need for improvement in for that. Thank you"
Fast service. Delicious nasi lemak. Tasty drink
"Ate here today... whoa, they need to tell the staff to smile more"
"The food server is very rude. No need to sit in front, sis, if you're going to treat people like that. The price of the dishes is considered cheap because the chicken is big."
"Not so hype, and the food was okay. The environment was good. The chili sauce was kind of sweet for me which I do not prefer."
Limited parking space but accessible..
"For me, it's kind of overrated because to me the sambal was ordinary...but serves many kinds of dishes too. Parking: Very crowded area, must pay to park at the parking area nearby"
Okay the portion of the rice is small
Took sotong which was ok. Sambal good but on the sweet side. Rice was a total let down. It was soggy and wet with no hint of coconut milk. Overall a bit overrated. Nasi lemak RM 10 and Nescafe drink RM4. Parking RM5. Price wise ok.
Took squid which was ok. The chili gravy good but on the sweet side. Rice was a total let down. It was soggy and wet with no hint of coconut milk. Overall a bit overrated. Nasi lemak RM 10 and Nescafe drink RM4. Parking RM5. Price wise ok.
Can get crowded but they have ample staff so things are cleaned quick
"Service that's less friendly from the front-of-house staff. The food is tasty. The portion of rice is too little. When selling, don't be stingy with blessings. Share a smile :)"
The nasi lemak is just average. The sambal is too sweet
Meets expectations. The nasi lemak is really delicious. The squid is incredibly tender. The portion is generous.
Best nasi lemak in town. Parking: Limited parking
overrated nasi lemak. sorry. expensive to me
"The food tastes normal. The price, it's expensive"
"Clean place. Efficient staff. They sweep whenever they see trash. But the issue is, the rice portion is very small. The dishes are delicious, but there's too little. Two bites, and it's gone. Hmm. Even sitting in the air-conditioned area has a charge. Please give a bit more rice."
The taste is too salty. It's too pricy. Parking: No parking lot
"2 stars because their nasi lemak just taste ok. Nothing special. Not worth my time to find parking and have to queue for food. Their avocado smoothies is the worst i ever taste ,it taste extremely bitter. End up have to throw away , waste my RM7"
"Such a nice place, very comfortable. Fast service"
"The Nasi Lemak was tasty. Enjoyed it thoroughly, super fast service too. However, the rice portion was quite small, but one may ask for extra rice ( chargeable RM1). Worth it, recommended!"
Parking is rather difficult ... for motorized people ... easy. Fast service ..
Nice nasi lemak. One of the best I had in KL. Thumbs up
"The place is very neat and clean. Very comfortable seating. As for the food, it's not as delicious as I expected. I couldn't finish eating, to be honest."
The food does not follow my liking. Service was great though.
The sambal is not spicy but a bit sweet. Quite pricey
An excellent place to enjoy traditional nasi lemak in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. The only challenge is to find a good parking slot but quite a several slots are there for a fee... it is a must try.
"The sambal is overly salty. Overall taste is just average, a lot of roadside nasi lemak at other places are much better than wanjo. The reviewers have overrated wanjo. I also ordered an additional small bowl of plain rice, they charged RM3. This is extremely pricey and I will not go back again."
Fried chicken also quite a letdown with minimal rempah to flood the nasi lemak. Enjoyed the rendang and ayam masak merah. The variety available. Fast-moving queue is a plus!
Parking is an issue. But the restaurant provides a good tasty nasi lemak. Price is still acceptable. They have a different lane for dine in and take-away. There are many other restaurants around. Surrounding looks very packed.
Sad nasi lemak. The chicken is so dry. My supper is so sad.
"Very clean environment, and lots of fans to keep you cool. Nasi lemak is very nice. The sambal is excessively sweet, and I find it unpleasant. Beef rendang is very delicious"
Service is satisfactory. The food is delicious.
"Very basic. The place was big and having ample of seating. The queue was long but manageable. Quite fast you are being served. The taste was just ordinary nothing more and nothing special. Toilets was clean and good water pressure. There were two seating areas which naturally aspirated air and air-conditioning section. For air conditioning section there is 1 ringgit levi per person per entry. Overall, just very basic and ordinary."
I think this is the best nasi lemak in town i've tried
"The food for me is average only. The place is so hot and humid, that is the most uncomfortable thing."
Just average food. The price is expensive
The dining place is indeed great. The squid is delicious.
"Tried it because of the hype. But I personally feel that it is nothing special.  The sambal has good enough heat but not enough flavor.  The rice texture is good and fragrant.  Traffic is bad around this area.  Paid parking available, RM 5 for 3 hours. The plain nasi lemak is RM 5 per plate."
Fast service. Nice food
"Best place for nasi lemak lovers. Great, they offer nasi lemak with various side dishes to choose from, such as sotong sambal, fried chicken, sambal clams, lung, and more."
A clean and bright shop. Friendly staff. Great prayer room. Provides free Coway water. Delicious food.
Nasi lemak is tasty
Nasi Lemak is okay
I left upset without eating. Turned off by the first server who scooped out rice curt attitude
Delicious! The spices are generous. The portion can truly make you full.
Very convenient services. Cheap and Delicious.
"Wow, their sambal is excellent!"
The food was great. The service was fast. The price was reasonable given the location and amount of the dishes
The rice is fragrant and has a rich coconut flavor. The ayam masak merah is delicious and tender. The fried chicken is sadly dry. Even the bergedils are soft and tender.
"Finally, I got to enjoy food. The taste is almost similar to Indonesian Nasi Uduk, but its distinctive feature lies in the slightly sweet sambal. It goes well with Teh Halia, which is pulled tea mixed with ginger extract, giving a warm feeling to the throat. It's quite crowded with many customers coming in."
Did not disappoint with the service
Why the staff do not smile? it makes the customer feels uncomfortable
Very good and neat place. The food was yummy. Add ons as you pay. Reasonable price.
"The nasi lemak was excellent. However, the chicken were inedible (tough meat). In the beef rendang, there was only sauce with at most 1 piece of meat. When I mentioned it, no attention was given to it."
Ooh i love it. The taste is good. And they have free flow water too. But the juice stuff didn't our fave things in here. The rest is awesome.
Love the food here! Went there two times. The avocado is great. The chocolate smoothie (9MYR) is tasty and filling.
There was already a queue when I arrived for breakfast today. It was quite systematic and it didn't take too long for my turn.
"The overall taste is good. A standard nasi lemak with no special dishes. The food presentation is in the style of nasi campur. There is ample dining space, and it's a self-service setup"
Not the best but surely not as bad as what the locals had be taunting endlessly. Love the variation of the side dishes. Some I would consider unique too. Will for sure come again and bring my international friends here.
Parking is hassle & need to be patience. Packed with people even at night. Their nasi lemak is good. Only the rice portion is a bit small for adults. It would be better if they could improve on that part. The place is clean and spacious!
The nasi lemak is rich and flavorful!. The sauce is abundant!! Need to exercise more after such a sumptuous meal.
Amazingly super clean restaurant environment. The Nasi Lemak not too bad. I wish the dish will have more milky coconut taste / feel. Sambal kerang is good.
Their nasi lemak is delicious and very filling. The smoothie had the perfect amount of sweetness and was not watery. Their pricing is very good.
The food was good. But the prices were too high. Even the portion was too small that wasn't enough for one serving
"This restaurant is one of the most famous ones for Malaysians. The staff was very fast. Its sambal sauce was special. Sotong was also good. But if you have a car, you need to find a good parking place. enjoy it."
"The shop is very clean. The food is okay. Reasonable prices. The portions are good. Squid fat & shredded rm10, are so delicious, loss if you don't buy"
"Spacious, bright, and clean. We opted for the aircond room as it was a hot day and paid RM1 per person."
Sambal was sweet which is unpleasant. I love the tea o ais limau only. 
"A different experience of Nasi Lemak. The taste is not bad. Very clean and hygienic place. Staff are very polite, well mannered and friendly. The price is surprisingly on the cheap side."
"Delicious, spicy sambal. The portion not bad. The price is a bit more expensive than usual but worth it."
Gone here with my family. The price is good for dinner. The food is good. Their chicken is big. Begedil is big. Service is fast. No wait at all on saturday night
"The nasi lemak is cooked perfectly. It's delicious and fragrant. It's neither mushy nor lacking in moisture. The sambal is mildly spicy and somewhat sweet and for me, it is tasty even though it's not very thick. The squid chili sauce also tastes great. The only unsatisfactory thing is hard to find parking"
Very yummy food!. Pretty good value for money. I ordered a lot as you can see from my photo and it was very reasonably priced.
"The nasi lemak is delicious. I felt sad when the sambal have a small portion of rice. The reason is that there are many side dishes. There are two seating areas. If you want air conditioning, it's an additional RM1 per person, but it's quite nice. It's hot outside. Coway water is provided for free. The iced syrup is delicious."
"Nasi lemak is okay. The quantity is small. The service is very bad. We were eating as a family with a baby and my mother who is differently-abled, and the waiter came and asked us to move the table, saying the boss is angry about tables being connected. Very rude, especially when people are in the middle of their meal. No common sense at all. Will not come again and not recommended to come."
"Wow! Fantastic food, incredible staff and a clean spot. We were in KL for three days and ate there every single day. No joke! A place where locals eat. Both the rendang chicken and beef are excellent. Do not leave here without the potato ball and a mango smoothie."
"Excellent place. Cheap, only locals inside and very few tourists! 4 of us ate Nasi lemak and ice teh tarik for altogether. 1 ringgit each to sit in an AC room. Overall amazing food, would return"
Delicious Nasi Lemak. The paru was crunchy yet still soft and the limpa was delicious. Ayam masak merah portion was big and so was the begedil. Drinks was on the sweeter side so ask for less sugar if you don't like them sweet.
"Their mango smoothies are highly recommended! A popular restaurant among locals, specializing in nasi lemak. Not the best I've ever tasted, but it offers good value and is quick."
"The flavor of the food becoming worse and worse. At one point, even the fried chicken was unflavourful. I used to love coming here for a quick meal and great teh ais. But I wouldn't repeat my visit after spending RM50 for two."
Good nasi lemak served here..
The taste has gone down. The sambal not spicy
"The place is clean. The staff are friendly. Most importantly the Nasi Lemak is awesome. Many varieties and selections of dishes to compliment the main menu as we all love it. One tip tho, come early for better parking."
"Only the fried chicken is tough and cold, not juicy. The rest, I like fragrant rice. The sambal is good. The anchovies are burnt."
I love this place. Good service. The price affordable and reasonable.
The best place. waiter is full of smiles. delicious food hot and fresh
Clean place. fast service. rice and sambal is average. seems overrated by all reviewing this restaurant.
the best nasi lemak in town
"The rice portion is very small, not worth it. The taste is just ordinary."
Nasi lemak is a bit hard. Unfriendly workers still hanging out even when customers come in
Very delicious. Been here twice. The service is also the best. The restroom is very clean and feels comfortable
Delicious nasi lemak. Ensure that the shop environment is always clean and cheerful.
So we arrived around 10.30am. The queue was long but moves very fast. 100 for the service. We really love their rendang daging and sambal kerang. The freshly made avocado + mango smoothies were really good too! Parking was quite hard to find.
"Oh man, where to even start!. This here is hands down where you are going to find the best nasi lemak in the city! The people are extremely nice and the customer service is amazing! They have many different kinds of chicken. They also make incredible smoothies! "
"The food doesnt live up to all the hype and buzz created by the media. Tastes like the average nasi lemak from any roadside stall. The rice isnt particularly fragrant. And the sambal,  nothing to shout about (a little too spicy though). But it has clean comfy seating, and popular with foreign tourists."
"A different experience of Nasi Lemak. The taste not bad. Very clean and hygienic place. Staff are very polite, well mannered and friendly. Price is surprisingly on the cheap side."
"First time eating at this place. It was fully seated, and we had to queue, but fortunately, it wasn't too long. Kudos to the management!"
"Delicious, spicy sambal. Portion not bad. The price is a bit more expensive than usual but worth it."
"I recently visited restaurant and my experience was mixed. The service was decent. The restaurant was clean. The atmosphere was okay, nothing too special. The nasi lemak itself was okay. "
"Long queue before can reach the counter. However, the service is fast. The rice is nice and creamy. Sambal is on sweeter side. Very focused menu serving only Nasi Lemak with fewer side dishes spread. "
"The taste of the food is still great in the new atmosphere. However, I am very disappointed with the service. When I came in during a quiet hour, the crew simply ignored me, and one of them even left, making me wait to place my order."
The service was quite fast as there's a lot of friendly staff to assist you with your food choice. Affordable price too.
"Their Nasi Lemak has a strong coconut milk flavor but is simply delicious. There is a wide variety of side dishes. restaurant is kept quite clean. The staff is very friendly, and the way they handle their work seems efficient. Overall, it's worth repeating"
Will always come and eat here whenever I am at Kampung Baru. The taste has not changed since the first time I ate it long long time ago. I grew up in Kampung Baru. The price is competitive but of course it good.
"The service was fast. When it came to the food, I was a little disappointed because the nasi lemak tasted salty. I bought several types of side dishes."
"I find the sambal quite unappealing, and it fails to bring any enjoyment to my palate."
"Tasty nasi lemak with a variety of lauk. Rice is soft but in normal portions. Rendang Ayam tastes great, similar to the one you ordered at Paparich. Parking is rm3 for 3 hours near this restaurant."
"An interesting place to enjoy nasi lemak. The fried chicken might be a bit tough, maybe because it's from an outside source. Overall, it's still okay. It's a bit challenging with this car parking situation."
Love the nasi lemak here!. The price was affordable and the place was surprisingly clean.
"Been here 3 times already. The only downside going here is the difficulty in finding a parking spot, as it is in Kg Baru. But once you reach the restaurant, you'll forget about it. You will be greeted by a helpful staff letting you know."
"The lungs are a bit cluttered, no spicy. There is an aircond place .. RM1 a person"
"A variety of dishes to choose from. The taste is great. The sambal is sweet, sour, and spicy. There is almost always a line, but the service is fast, although you can expect a 10-20 minute waiting time. The place is expanding, and you can opt for the air-conditioned dining area as an add-on."
"Located on the busy street in Kg Baru, this is the best nasi lemak in Kg Baru, if not in KL. A comfortable place for all day and late night dining"
"Efficient service and quite spacious, with many choices of compliment and drinks. There is an air-conditioned space, and the staff is great. However, the taste of nasi lemak and the side dishes is average to below average."
Average nasi lemak for tourists. Eating in the air-conditioned room costs RM1 per head. The rice portion is quite small. Maybe it's just a one-time visit.
"Brand new place, neat and comfortable. Delicious and appetizing food. A little pricey, but worth it. Original nasi lemak taste."
"The queue is very long but worth it. Don't talk about car parking; it's crowded. It's better to take the LRT, stop near Kampung Bharu, and then walk around 3 minutes; the distance is short. Their system is very efficient; you pay first before eating."
"One of the Best nasi lemak around here. The sambal was more to the sweeter side, which I LOVED so much. Fried chicken was so soft and flavourful. Highly recommended."
Still can't get over how good this food was. Amazing nasi lemak went and had two portions trying different sides
They have too many workers. 3 sat at the front of the store just to welcome the customers (which is excessive IMO). The service was absolutely awful.
It's a very awesome Nasi lemak. Definitely worth coming and trying it for yourself. Parking might be difficult to get over here. Shop itself is clean and well-lit. It has nice fluffy rice with strong santan.
