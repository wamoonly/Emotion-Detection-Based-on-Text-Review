Chesper-Joghne Pang,6 months ago,"Loved, loved, loved Wanjo's Nasi Lemak! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜˜â¤ï¸Being Singaporean, it's hard to get used to the Malaysian Nasi Lemak, primarily because the sambal in Malaysia is generally more liquid and gravy-like, with slivers of onions swimming in it and less sweet, and that small deep-fried ikan kuning is nowhere to be seen.  The rice is often overcooked and clumpy.Then I found Wanjo ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ by accident whilst visiting Kampong Bharu.  Wanjo's sambal, although still more liquid and gravy-like, is just as sweet as Singapore's version that I grew up with, without those annoying lumpy onions.   The rice is aromatic, fragrant and cooked to perfection - each rice grain is separate and QQ to the bite.The price was exceptionally reasonable, I thought, given the exceptional standard of the Nasi Lemak and accomplishments offered at Wanjo's.We beat the crowd, got our Nasi Lemak with different accompaniments - I had beef lung, sotong and fried egg omelette, whilst my partner had deep-fried chicken, and found our seats at the non-air-conditioned area.  It was a great dining experience with a crowd of equally satisfied, happy (and noisy ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) patrons.The service line was quick, and the staff was exceptionally friendly, who were extremely quick to respond and patient with this English-speaking inquisitive Singaporean and his Caucasian partner.Although there's still no small deep-fried ikan kuning, we left extremely satisfied, and happy with smiles and praise.  We'll gladly return to Wanjo again and again, just for the Nasi Lemak.  My partner absolutely loved Wanjo!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸"

Wong KC,2 years ago,Best Nasi lemak in KL. Has overtaken Nasi lemak international that is next door. Should try their sotong and beef. You need to ask for more rice which they charge extra. Our office buys this in 80 packs for our staff meeting. They will deliver to your office even in the evening . Somehow it taste better in a packet which users banana leaf . Must be the blend of aroma with the banana leaf with the sambal . Must try if you are nearby
Joshua Soo,4 years ago,"Love the rice in the nasi lemak, probably the most fragrant I had. However, the rest of the stuff is probably average at best. Prices aren't that cheap, but then that's to be expected in the middle of KL. Keep your expectations reasonable on the store hygiene and you'll be alright here. Else, if you're willing to travel then Village Park is a better option."

Abe R,2 years ago,Always heard about Wanjo from my nephews.Hence it was a must for me to also try out their Nasi Lemak.Dang ! My NLemak Ayam Goreng & Sambal Sotong was fabulously delicious.
Frederick Thew,a year ago,"Sweet nasi lemak. Spicy level is the tourist level. Sweet and not spicy at all. Chickens are on the hard side, not tender."
Muhamad Asywadi,3 years ago,Nasi lemak is good. Nasi is sebutir sebutir because it is kukus-ed. Sambal is not the best I've had. Paru is not that good. Rendang is good. Service is good. Parking can be found easily at RM5. But I had high hope for this nasi lemak because of the rave reviews.
azlan abdul aziz,3 years ago,"This place have been around a very long time in iconic Kampong Bahru. This is only the second time I am tasting the nasi lemak with the choosing of your own favourite lauk, be it with meat, cuttlefish, chicken, or limpa( don't know what's its called in English). My opinion the best nasi lemak in town. Will for sure go again when the cravings gets to me!."
Zahri Muda,8 months ago,Nasi tak banyak sgt kena tambah nasi hehehehe rendang ayam sedap tapi sejuk
Nia Kurniasih,4 years ago,"I've tried nasi lemak here and there in Malaysia and this one is so far the yummiest of all despite its moderate prices. The spicy beef with coconut sauce is the second best next to Rendang. The owner has been very hospitable too and the staff is efficient. Next time I'm in KL again, I'll definitely go there again for the food."

Joseph Foo,3 years ago,"Had nasi lemak at the shop in the evening. The nasi was nice but not as flavourful as I hoped. The dishes were cold and limited. However, the staff were friendly and service was good. I will suggest maybe going in the morning or early afternoon will probably be better."
Andrew G Gopal,2 years ago,"Set in the heart of Kampung Baru, I feel this Nasi Lemak over shadows the more famously known Antarabangsa. The crowd justifies this. The rice is fluffy top with sambal which is slightly sweet for my liking. Rendang chicken, fried chicken and sambal chicken is decent. Good and systematic service for eat it or take out."
SITI AINI,9 months ago,Very nice nasi lemak..good taste also...can go there again....yum2
Soofish H,4 years ago,"So far one of the best ones I’ve tried. Tasty sambal, juicy chicken, good service and surprisingly pretty clean because cleanliness is not something you normally encounter in Kampung Baru or most gerai in general.

It's really good, sweet and a little spicy. I deep everything with that sauce and it tastes like heaven! Overall it costs RM 12.2 included ice milk tea.

A little expensive for a Nasi Lemak but I guess that's the standard these days especially at that area. Seatings are proper and spacious; and better lit. Parking at this area is always a problem, so there's nothing to say about it."

Kuruvilla C.K.Joseph,5 years ago,"Overrated. Sambal tastes too strong and sweet. Doesn't look or taste like freshly ground chili. Tastes more like it's made using chilli boh. Pricey too. RM8 for a plate with egg and fried chicken. Fried chicken tasted quite nice. Will I crave for this nasi lemak? Definitely not! Have tasted much better nasi lemak sold by the roadsides in the morning. Need to factor in the parking charges too: RM5 per entry. Drinks are not freshly made, pre-made: milo ais, kopi ais, teh ais. Overall, DISAPPOINTED! 4/10 Max!"
kav,4 years ago,"This is kind of too overrated compared with other stalls. Let me start off from pricing, 4 ringgit for a basic nasi lemak including rice, cucumber, egg and sambal is too overpriced and yet it only gives such a less amount of it. The pricing for add ons are reasonable."

The food was simple yet incredibly delicious, giving a genuine canteen-like feel rather than a fancy fine-dining atmosphere. The value for money was excellent â€“ you definitely get your money's worth.The pace was fast, the place bustling with locals, and there was no sign of tourists in sight. This added to the authenticity of the experience. While it's not a place for a lavish 5-star dining experience or a three-course meal, the flavors were out of this world. If you're after genuine, mouthwatering food, Nasi Lemak Wanjo Kg Baro is a must-visit."

Fatynanana,4 months ago,So we arrived around 10.30am. The queue was long but moves very fast. 100 for the service. We really love their rendang daging and sambal kerang. The freshly made avocado + mango smoothies were really good too! Parking was quite hard to find but you can opt to a parking space with a flat rate of RM5. They accept cashless payment (card & QR code) except at the juice station. Definitely would come again.

Jennifer Li,4 months ago,"My husband and I loved this place! We were looking for a restaurant that specialized in no frills Nasi Lemak and we are so glad we decided on this place! Ordering was efficient because it was cafeteria style, and all of the sides were delicious. Our favorite was the Ayam Masak Merah! We went at 10:30AM on a Thursday, and even then there was a short line and the place was pretty full. Not sure what it is like during peak hours but from what I saw, I would recommend avoiding peak hours."
Fernan Mascarinas,5 months ago,"If you want good, affordable, Malaysian Food, you have come to the right place.After walking for at least 25 minutes from where I stay, I found this gem of a place in Chowkit. This restaurant has thousands of reviews and yet it maintained a high score of above 4! That, of course, says a lot about the taste, quality (and even quantity) of food here!Since I do not know how to speak Bahasa, I asked for the staff's recommendation and ordered Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang, plus mango shake and Bedegil (simply put, fried potato ball with beef inside). They were very accommodating with my questions! Boy oh boy, the chicken was soft, almost falling off the bone, but still juicy and moist! The rendang sauce is perfectly seasoned, and the other ingredients of the Nasi Lemak made it even more delicious. The mango shake is outstanding too, though not a sweet variety, but you can eat mango chunks after. CHUNKS, not bits and pieces!Upon checking, they have value meals ranging from 5.80 MYR to 13 MYR, and feel free to have add ons! They have a wide selection of drinks too. They also have drinkibg water if you don't feel like ordering drinks.By the way, the place is HUGE, and people come, eat, and goâ€”a testament to their popularity! I even saw a foreigners eat here. They have a handwashing station, and toilets too.They say if you want to eat good food, you have to eat with the locals. And indeed, this restaurant is one for the books in this area of KL."

fariha zulkiply,4 months ago,Clean shop. You have to go up the LRT to be comfortable because you don't have to worry about parking. Fast service. Nasi lemak and sambal are delicious.

So if you like your sambal extra spicy, this may not be the place for you.The rendang daging was surprisingly good. Kurang lemak. Daging lembut and sedap. A must try.Outlet was clean and there were a lot of workers. Meaning it doesn't look like Wanjo exploits basic skilled workforce. There is an aircond section for customers at RM1 per person.They have clean surau. Air-conditioned. So you can go at anytime and pray there.Coway water was free.The price is not Rahmah pricing. But its reasonable pricing at market rate. Can even be slightly lower than market rate."
Irwan Studio,7 months ago,It one of the best nasi lemak in KL!! Totally recommended!! Everything was soo delicious and the price is affordable too if compare to living in kl food price. Everyone must try at least once before they leave KL! Or u stay kl but never being here before!!

For air conditioning section there is 1 ringgit levi per person per entry.Overall, just very basic and ordinary."

idris jaafar,9 months ago,Got up early and gone to this Nasi Lemak cafe at Kg Baru.Had the nasi lemak with chicken tomato and cuttlefish sambals. Sambal was not that spicy but on the sweet side. Probably for a vast range of customers rather than too spicy and only cater for small group. They may want to offer different level of spiciness for different customers.Chicken was a bit tough to cut and tasty.The hot lemon tea O kosong was nice with the nasi lemak.! Nice experience..!The queue began to grow as we finished our breakfast!
along putera,9 months ago,Tempat yang menarik utk nikmati nasi lemak. Just bagi selera aku ok ja tapi tetap boleh rasa dan nikmati cuma rasa kurang sebab ayam goreng maybe kat luar jadi tidak ranggup.

Gunasekar Mariappan,9 months ago,Long queue before can reach the counter. However the service is fast. The rice is nice and creamy: Sambal is on sweeter side. Very focused menu serving only Nasi Lemak with fewer side dishes spread.Definitely this is a better Nasi Lemak compared to other popular brands and the price is cheaper compare to others brands.
Edward maling,9 months ago,Mknn sedap
Shahrul nova,9 months ago,Harga nasi lemak high
Yusri Yusop,9 months ago,"I recently visited Restaurant Nasi Lemak Wan Jo and my experience was mixed. The service was decent and the restaurant was clean. The atmosphere was okay, nothing too special. The nasi lemak itself was okay, it was decent but nothing particularly stood out. The nasi lemak telur mata/nasi lemak telur rebus was decent and reasonably priced at RM5. The price overall is on the higher side, but not exorbitant. Overall, while I wasn't blown away by my experience, I didn't have any major complaints. If you're in the area and looking for nasi lemak, it may be worth giving Nasi Lemak Wan Jo a try, but there may be better options in the area."

Abi Abdul,9 months ago,An excellent place to enjoy traditional nasi lemak in the heart of Kuala Lumpur...its a popular place with fresh fruit juices to choose from to go with your nasi lemak in addition to hot coffee or tea or other beverages. The only challenge is to find a good parking slot but quite a number of slots are there for a fee...its must try.
Mustafa Behrami,9 months ago,Really tasty and cheap food!
Upick ckck,9 months ago,"Nasi Lemak restaurant, the taste is very good, different from the nasi lemak which I often eat in Indonesia, the cakes, eggs, fried chicken, anchovies and rice are really delicious.

Rice - The aroma of nasi lemak is really fragrant. 1 of the best nasilemak. Sambal - thick texture, skit sweet. I don't have anchovies in sambal. Can't say it's delicious. Usually2. Fried chicken - bg sy, file da. Because it was fried for a long time, until there was no juice left. It's dry. Hard. Telo goreng - cun ???? Atmosphere - I give 4 stars, because the place is clean"
Tiara Samsara,9 months ago,"This restaurant is overrated!!! The sambal is too sweet, coconut rice is not fragrant, the beef rendang is dry and tough and no peanuts. Not sure what the hype is about!

Mohd Ridzuan,9 months ago,"Had chicken & beef rendang for supper with 5 other family members.

Lea Marini,9 months ago,"Suka potongan timun dan ikan bilis. Nasi itself pon sedap. Cuma masalah dia adalah sambal manis. Memang ada setengah orang prefer sambal manis, kadang-kadang saya pon suka. Tapi sila saya haritu, saya minta sotong dan kerang sekalikan di pinggan lepastu campur dengan sambal biasa, bila dah bawak di meja, suapan pertama saya macam makan dessert. Saya makan lagi 2-3 suap, rasa muak sebab manis sangat. Nasi dan lauk saya banyak lagi, jadi saya terpaksa bangun dan order nasi sahaja sebab nasi dipinggan penuh sambal manis, jadi saya beli nasi je untuk habiskan lauk. Pesanan buat semua, kalau nak order sotong dan kerang sekali, minta asing. Kalau tak nanti engko semua makan nasi lemak manis untuk dinner dan juga pencuci mulut. Ok tu je, bye."
Chelsi Riordan,9 months ago,"Wow! Fantastic food, incredible staff and clean spot. We were in KL for three days and ate here every single day—no joke! Definitely a place where locals eat.

Also the sambal is so overrated, rasa macam sambal hangit yang tak sempat masak dengan sempurna, more to manis je (they can do better). Sorry to say, but it’s not worth it to queue up in a long line but eventually just to taste that overrated nasi lemak. The price is also quite expensive"

Food wise nothing to shout about, just so-so.. other roadside nasi lemak much better taste than here, the nasi quite tasteless no aroma santan at all, maybe cost cutting not to use enough santan for the nasi, and any ""ayam"" dish is freaking expensive, eg. the ayam goreng rempah, ayam masak merah and ayam rendang each will cost you RM 10 per piece!!! Within the restaurant they have another special area with air conditioner will charge for adult RM 1 (except for child below 10 year old)."
Mochammad Hadyan,,"The best nasi lemak in town, no one can't beat the sambal bilis. So good.The place is cozy and spacious.One more thing, you can have free water from the dispenser. So unlimited water!You must visit this place!"
Tech Jack,,This was my first try of this establishment. I had the nasi lemak with fried egg and one bergedil added on. The rice was well cooked and the coconut milk was quite generously integrated. However the amount of rice which they dished out onto the plate was not a lot. So those who are very hungry they should ask for extra rice. I have tried nasi lemak from many places and I would  rate this one from Wanjo very highly as among the top 5 in and around KL.
Siti Nur Hazwani Md Sabudin,,"Servis laju. Makan sedap. Sotong lembut. Nak makan nasi lemak sedap tanpa ragu, boleh datang sini."
Rendang Lover,,"I visited for the first time in about 4 years, but the store was beautifully renovated. I ate Ayam Rendang, but it's a Rendang, so it's obvious that it's delicious, but it wasn't particularly delicious. I think it used to be a little tastier. Also, the Sambal here is a little too sweet for me."
Mohd Azman Mohd Yussof,,Enjoy the food
Laily Rachmah,,Nasi lemak nya sedap
Wahyu Kresna,,"Best place for Nasi Lemak. Fast service, clean, spacious place, good taste, and cheap. A must try."

Ahmed Syam Che Kub,,"Lots of side dishes selection, swift service and reasonable price"
"Moch Faisal Karim, PhD",,This is our first time eating here. The nasi lemak is awesome. The sambal is tasty. The ayam bakar and ayam gulai are good. But the ayam gulai is a bit sweet. Paru paru is a bit hard to chew. The price is relatively cheap. Will be back again
Adrian Kamajaya,,"The food was pretty good for my (Indonesian) stomach, I was a little confused right after eating, I was charged 1 ringgit. It turns out that eating in a room with AC costs 1 Ringgit. Hahahahahahaha"
Faizal Sahari,,Was really curious from the YouTube reviews.Parking was a breeze as there’s a RM5 parking lots.Tasting is believing. The sambal took me back to my primary school days. Sweet and spicy just perfect. The ‘bergedil’ was handmade and delicious. If only the rice can be more fragrant and lemak it would have been a perfect score.
Emily Chng,,"Well, this place is famous for sure. You'll see locals and tourists alike. They have a variety of dishes to accompany the basic nasi lemak. While I enjoyed the fried chicken, bergedil and tempe , I didn't really enjoy the sambal. It's too sweet for my liking, but that's just my opinion from someone from Northern Malaysia who prefers the sambal to be salty."
megapapa,,"For Indonesian travelers, they will definitely like it"
Meera Sha,,"Nice and decent clean place .As for the price is easy on your wallet.Varieties of dishes to choose from.Nasi lemak sambal is nice , but personally I prefer it to be abit more spicy:)"
Jayanti Hunter,,So yummy and cheap!
George Khoo,,The rice was really fragrant and the chilli nice and sweet. Otherwise the fried chicken was tough and the coffee really quite bad. But service staff was friendly. Food was quite ordinary. It's really in an ulu spot with many other local eateries but no problem getting there by cab
kays,,fourteen dollars for nasi lemak with chicken thigh + sotong. was quite yummy but no peanuts served and the sambal is on the sweeter side. free water and cups! not too difficult to get to from the train. fairly clean but could be better. great service and overall a good experience
Abdul Aziz,,"Rasa sambal sentiasa berubah, x tetep,harga kayangan."
Zainudin AB,,Nikmat makanan yang sungguh tak terkata.
Dhalan Ismail,,Best nasi lemak
Haziq Radzi,,"I have come to this place a few times already. Before and after renovation. Tbh, it was an okay restaurant. Not that great, but not that bad either. The taste of the Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng and Bergedil is quite delicious, but I have tasted better Nasi Lemak at other restaurants. The sambal is not spicy but still acceptable. The price is quite expensive for a quite average Nasi Lemak. Overall, it's an okay experience eating at this restaurant."
Lois CH,,"come here bcoz of >6000 google reviews, taste so-so only, egg not fresh can see from the shape, parking cheapest RM3 same road, 8am already many people. Ayam rendamg too salty, RM10 nssi lemak + ayam rendang ok, just taste not as good as expected."
Jo Adam,,"Nasi lemak is the thread..and true, u won't find plain rice, noodle,fried rice or whatever else, other than nasi lemak. More than 20 'lauk pauk'  to go with the nasi lemak, arranged nearly in center of the spacious shop. Yes the place was very spacious..tables were put comfortably apart one to another..The paint was of bright color which brightened whole shop making your taking meal there very relaxing g apart the wide personal space everyone sure had it. Food on the menu was definitely scrumptious and super clean to my eyes. Drinks were sold from dispensers at counter and fresh fruit juices were at front. Prices were as usual as ordinary standard mark ups."

My husband and I came late that night, so there were a liittle choice of side dishes for the nasi lemak. The price is quite acceptable due to the location. The challenge is to find a parking space to park your vehicle. Even though there are many places provided paid parking lots but when we arrived all of the parking lots were full."

Kaleighpot,4 years ago,The food was ok. Most of the staff are nice even though lacking in English. But what I wasn't happy about is I was charged RM24 for 2 plates of nasi lemak and teh tarik. I didn't know then that that price is too much only learned after a few days of stay.
zulurology,4 years ago,"Another gem in Kg Baru, Spacious restaurant but again parking is difficult. Go with Grab. Hot Steamy nasi lemak with lots of side dishes. I love their crispy chicken and Sotong Sambal and also their Pegedil. There are also beef rendang , Paru Sambal. Cheap but Excellent"
sizsiriporn,4 years ago,"Love the sambal that comes with the rice. Not too spicy, easy to eat. Fried chicken was a bit dry, so good to order a cup of hot milk tea to wash it down. :) The milk tea was made just nice, not too sweet."

Barney1984,4 years ago,We were visiting Kampung Baru and wanted somewhere for a traditional breakfast and found Wanjo mentioned online. This was the first time we’d tried Nasi Lemak and we certainly weren’t disappointed.My wife ordered the satay chicken to go with her rice and I went for beef rendang. Both were delicious as were the accompaniments to the rice. The Sambal sauce was spicy but not crazy and had a sweetness to it which worked really well.
ArieDiepern,5 years ago,"I had a great time eating here. It doesn't look like much but the food is great. I loved the food, especially the rendang. Great bumbu. I also loved their red lemonade. The staff is very polite and nice. Definitely worth a visit."

The taste of the Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng and Bergedil is quite delicious, but I have tasted better Nasi Lemak at other restaurants. The sambal is not spicy but still acceptable. The price is quite expensive for a quite average Nasi Lemak. Overall, it's an okay experience eating at this restaurant."

That will be my first and last to visit."

Ideal Peninsula,a year ago,Nasi lemak taste like a plain rice. Sambal too sweet. Anchovies given too little and u must pay for the boiled egg that supposed to be free. Not worth it at all.. too pricey too.. should improve on your service
Kamarul Anuar,a year ago,Konsep layan diri. Tiada service ke meja. Ada dua baris untuk beratur. Satu UTK dine in dan satu bungkus.

Slip order akan keluar di tempat air mcm kedai mamak tu.
