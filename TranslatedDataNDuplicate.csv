Chesper-Joghne Pang,6 months ago,"Loved, loved, loved Wanjo's Nasi Lemak! Ã°Å¸Ëâ¹Ã°Å¸ËËÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂBeing Singaporean, it's hard to get used to the Malaysian Nasi Lemak, primarily because the sambal in Malaysia is generally more liquid and gravy-like, with slivers of onions swimming in it and less sweet, and that small deep-fried ikan kuning is nowhere to be seen.  The rice is often overcooked and clumpy.Then I found Wanjo Ã°Å¸Ëâ¹Ã°Å¸Ëâ¹Ã°Å¸Ëâ¹Ã°Å¸ËËÃ°Å¸ËËÃ°Å¸ËË by accident whilst visiting Kampong Bharu.  Wanjo's sambal, although still more liquid and gravy-like, is just as sweet as Singapore's version that I grew up with, without those annoying lumpy onions.   The rice is aromatic, fragrant and cooked to perfection - each rice grain is separate and QQ to the bite.The price was exceptionally reasonable, I thought, given the exceptional standard of the Nasi Lemak and accomplishments offered at Wanjo's.We beat the crowd, got our Nasi Lemak with different accompaniments - I had beef lung, sotong and fried egg omelette, whilst my partner had deep-fried chicken, and found our seats at the non-air-conditioned area.  It was a great dining experience with a crowd of equally satisfied, happy (and noisy Ã°Å¸ËâÃ°Å¸ËâÃ°Å¸Ëâ) patrons.The service line was quick, and the staff was exceptionally friendly, who were extremely quick to respond and patient with this English-speaking inquisitive Singaporean and his Caucasian partner.Although there's still no small deep-fried ikan kuning, we left extremely satisfied, and happy with smiles and praise.  We'll gladly return to Wanjo again and again, just for the Nasi Lemak.  My partner absolutely loved Wanjo!Ã°Å¸âÂÃ°Å¸âÂÃ°Å¸âÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â","Absolutely adored Wanjo's Nasi Lemak! ?????? As a Singaporean, adapting to Malaysian Nasi Lemak was challenging due to the different sambal and absence of certain elements. However, stumbling upon Wanjo in Kampong Bharu was a game-changer. Their sambal, while still liquid, matched the sweetness I grew up with, minus the bothersome onions. The rice was impeccably cooked, each grain separate and delightful. Despite the absence of a small deep-fried ikan kuning, the exceptional Nasi Lemak and reasonable prices at Wanjo's left us immensely satisfied. Quick service, friendly staff, and a vibrant, happy crowd make it an experience worth repeating. Can't wait to return for more of Wanjo's Nasi Lemak delights! ??????"
