Chesper-Joghne Pang,6 months ago,"Loved, loved, loved Wanjo's Nasi Lemak! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜˜â¤ï¸Being Singaporean, it's hard to get used to the Malaysian Nasi Lemak, primarily because the sambal in Malaysia is generally more liquid and gravy-like, with slivers of onions swimming in it and less sweet, and that small deep-fried ikan kuning is nowhere to be seen.  The rice is often overcooked and clumpy.Then I found Wanjo ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ by accident whilst visiting Kampong Bharu.  Wanjo's sambal, although still more liquid and gravy-like, is just as sweet as Singapore's version that I grew up with, without those annoying lumpy onions.   The rice is aromatic, fragrant and cooked to perfection - each rice grain is separate and QQ to the bite.The price was exceptionally reasonable, I thought, given the exceptional standard of the Nasi Lemak and accomplishments offered at Wanjo's.We beat the crowd, got our Nasi Lemak with different accompaniments - I had beef lung, sotong and fried egg omelette, whilst my partner had deep-fried chicken, and found our seats at the non-air-conditioned area.  It was a great dining experience with a crowd of equally satisfied, happy (and noisy ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) patrons.The service line was quick, and the staff was exceptionally friendly, who were extremely quick to respond and patient with this English-speaking inquisitive Singaporean and his Caucasian partner.Although there's still no small deep-fried ikan kuning, we left extremely satisfied, and happy with smiles and praise.  We'll gladly return to Wanjo again and again, just for the Nasi Lemak.  My partner absolutely loved Wanjo!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸","Absolutely adored Wanjo's Nasi Lemak! ?????? As a Singaporean, adapting to Malaysian Nasi Lemak was challenging due to the different sambal and absence of certain elements. However, stumbling upon Wanjo in Kampong Bharu was a game-changer. Their sambal, while still liquid, matched the sweetness I grew up with, minus the bothersome onions. The rice was impeccably cooked, each grain separate and delightful. Despite the absence of a small deep-fried ikan kuning, the exceptional Nasi Lemak and reasonable prices at Wanjo's left us immensely satisfied. Quick service, friendly staff, and a vibrant, happy crowd make it an experience worth repeating. Can't wait to return for more of Wanjo's Nasi Lemak delights! ??????"

Lea Marini,9 months ago,"Suka potongan timun dan ikan bilis. Nasi itself pon sedap. Cuma masalah dia adalah sambal manis. Memang ada setengah orang prefer sambal manis, kadang-kadang saya pon suka. Tapi sila saya haritu, saya minta sotong dan kerang sekalikan di pinggan lepastu campur dengan sambal biasa, bila dah bawak di meja, suapan pertama saya macam makan dessert. Saya makan lagi 2-3 suap, rasa muak sebab manis sangat. Nasi dan lauk saya banyak lagi, jadi saya terpaksa bangun dan order nasi sahaja sebab nasi dipinggan penuh sambal manis, jadi saya beli nasi je untuk habiskan lauk. Pesanan buat semua, kalau nak order sotong dan kerang sekali, minta asing. Kalau tak nanti engko semua makan nasi lemak manis untuk dinner dan juga pencuci mulut. Ok tu je, bye.","Like cucumber pieces and anchovies.The rice is delicious.The only problem is that he is a sweet sambal.There are some people prefer sweet sambal, sometimes I like it.But please let me that, I asked for squid and shellfish on the plate mixed with regular sambal, when I was brought to the table, my first feed was like eating dessert.I ate another 2-3 bribes, it tasted so sweet.My rice and side dishes are more, so I had to get up and order rice only because the rice was full of sweet sambal, so I bought rice to finish the side dishes.Orders for all, if you want to order squid and oysters, ask for a foreigner.If not, you will all eat sweet fat rice for dinner and dessert.Ok tu je, bye."

Emily Chng,,"Well, this place is famous for sure. You'll see locals and tourists alike. They have a variety of dishes to accompany the basic nasi lemak. While I enjoyed the fried chicken, bergedil and tempe , I didn't really enjoy the sambal. It's too sweet for my liking, but that's just my opinion from someone from Northern Malaysia who prefers the sambal to be salty.","Well, this place is famous for sure.
